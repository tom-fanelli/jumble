# jumble

Play the game [here!](https://jumble.live)

This is simple browser-based game where users are met with the challenge of unscrambling 3 words: one which is four letters long, one
which is five letters long, and one which is six letters long.

There is a new jumble challenge each day at 00:00 EDT.

This game was inspired by Josh Wardle's Wordle.

Built by me, _mostly_. Many thanks to the creators of the following:
